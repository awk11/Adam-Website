# Adam-Website
Adam Kaufman's Personal Website

Welcome to the README for my personal website's repository! The code is structured in to a few sections. 

The front end was built using Vue 3, with Bootstrap 5 as the base UI framework. It's code can be found in the Adam-Website folder. 

The back end is a NodeJS and ExpressJS API, connecting to some JSON files that act as a makeshift database (actual db's are expensive to host). This can all be found in the Node-Server folder.

Lastly there's the MediaBucket folder, which acts as my mock file bucket to pull all of the various media i use throughout the site.
