These projects range in size from small internal tech demos to large-scale dozen-plus organization efforts. I have been and am actively responsible for building and maintaining a diverse range of codebases across each project I've been a part of, as well as leading and managing small teams from the conception phase to production. Project focuses have included topics such as AI, media forensics, simulation, and more. <br /><br />For one such project which I can publicly speak about, I was a part of PAR's team for the DARPA Sail-On Program. This is a large research effort that focused on learning how various AIs understand and adapt to novelty and novel situations. In my work, I collaborated with a large variety of other organizations also involved in this project and contributed to work resulting in multiple papers. As the lead developer on my team, I was specifically responsible for managing several codebases used for testing AI Systems built by and with multiple other organizations we partnered with. This work included API development, video and image manipulation, video game modification and development, and many other fields of interest. Programming work is primarily done in Python.<br />More information about Sail-On can be found at <a href='https://www.darpa.mil/program/science-of-artificial-intelligence-and-learning-for-open-world-novelty' target = '_blank' rel='noopener'>darpa.mil/sail-on</a><br /><a href='arxiv.org/abs/2212.12141' target = '_blank' rel='noopener'>Published research paper can be found here.</a><br /><a href='https://github.com/darpa-sail-on' target = '_blank' rel='noopener'>Open Source code can be found here.</a>",

The game was made in XNA, and was done as a class project. I worked on it as the lead designer and AI programmer, as well as worked on a level editor and the level implementation and other various tasks. For the enemies movement AI I implemented A* path finding. You can check out the <a href='https://github.com/SolidSoup/BatGame' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>GitHub repo here</a>.

For the hackathon, we had a weekend to build a multi-platform app. So what we eventually created by the end of the weekend was Lively. Lively is an app that allows you to create photo collections based on vacations, life events, or whatever your heart desires, and tag a location for the event so you never forget where it was. In addition, you can also write short blurbs about each picture you add to a collection, similar to how people write on the backs of actual photographs. Lively has both iOS and tvOS functionality, and transfers data over iCloud for the user to use both asynchronously. For the app, my contributions were primarily all of the front end programming and design work for the iOS version. I did a lot of the constraints and storyboard work, as well as designed the logo and look of the app. I also implemented the location tagging feature. This was my first experience using Swift in any capacity. The GitHub repo can be viewed <a href='https://github.com/SMaraia/Lively' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>here</a>.
