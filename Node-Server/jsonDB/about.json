	"bio": "Hello there! My name is Adam Kaufman. Welcome to my career portfolio website. I graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree from Rochester Institute of Technology in 2017 majoring in Game Design and Development, but my skills extend far beyond just the video game industry. In my 6+ years of experience since joining the world of high tech, I have been fortunate enough to have opportunities that allowed me to become both an accomplished programmer and project leader. I have worked independently, as part of large teams, and as a team lead on projects of varying scales, using varying technologies, from conception to production. I am without a doubt a Full Stack Developer, having experience in everything from blocking out a UI in Photoshop to setting up database servers and connecting them to APIs. I thrive best in novel situations where I am learning something brand new as I work with it and move the project along. Right now, I am working at PAR Government, where I've been for nearly 3 and a half years and worked on a lot of different projects and with a lot of different people. While I've grown a lot in my time there and enjoy what I do, I'm always open to bigger and better opportunities.<br /><br />Outside of my working life, I am also an avid traveler. I'm based out of New York in the United States, but I spend most of my time working and living on the road. The images above are a small sample of my recent travels. So far, I've gone to pretty much every corner of the continental US, and have plans for much more. With that in mind, I am only interested in <strong>fully remote opportunities</strong> that will allow me to continue traveling full time and explore the world as I work.",
