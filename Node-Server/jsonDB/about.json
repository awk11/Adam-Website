	"bio": "Hello there! My name is Adam Kaufman. Welcome to my career portfolio website. I graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree from Rochester Institute of Technology in 2017. My major was Game Design and Development, but my skills extend far beyond just the video game industry. In my time since joining the world of high tech, I have been fortunate enough to have opportunities that allowed me to become both an accomplished programmer and project leader. I have worked independantly, as part of a large teams, and as a team lead on projects of varying scale, using varying technologies, from conception to production. I am without a doubt a Full Stack Developer, having experience in everything from blocking out a ui in photoshop to setting up database server's and connecting them to API's. I thrive best in novel situations where I am learning something brand new as I work with it and move the project along. Right now, I am working at PAR Government, where I've been for nearly 3 and a half years and worked on a lot of different projects and with a lot of different people. While I've grown a lot in my time there and enjoy what I do, I'm always open to bigger and better opportunities.<br /><br />Outside of my working life, I am also an avid traveler. I'm based out of New York in the United States but I spend most of my time working and living on the road. So far I've gone to pretty much every corner of the continental United States, and have plans for much more. With that in mind, I am only interested in <strong>fully remote opportunities</strong> that will allow me to continue traveling full time and explore the world.",
